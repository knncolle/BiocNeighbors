\title{Find all neighbors in range}
\usage{
findNeighbors(
  X,
  threshold,
  get.index = TRUE,
  get.distance = TRUE,
  num.threads = 1,
  subset = NULL,
  ...,
  BNPARAM = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix where rows correspond to data points and columns correspond to variables (i.e., dimensions).
Alternatively, a prebuilt index from \code{\link{buildIndex}}.}

\item{threshold}{A positive numeric scalar specifying the maximum distance at which a point is considered a neighbor.
Alternatively, a vector containing a different distance threshold for each point.}

\item{get.index}{A logical scalar indicating whether the indices of the neighbors should be recorded.}

\item{get.distance}{A logical scalar indicating whether distances to the neighbors should be recorded.}

\item{num.threads}{Integer scalar specifying the number of threads to use for the search.}

\item{subset}{An integer, logical or character vector specifying the indices of points in \code{X} for which the nearest neighbors should be identified.
This yields the same result as (but is more efficient than) subsetting the output matrices after computing neighbors for all points.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to pass to \code{\link{buildIndex}} when \code{X} is not an external pointer.}

\item{BNPARAM}{A \linkS4class{BiocNeighborParam} object specifying how the index should be constructed.
If \code{NULL}, this defaults to a \linkS4class{KmknnParam}.
Ignored if \code{x} contains a prebuilt index.}
}
\value{
A list is returned containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{index}, if \code{get.index=TRUE}.
This is a list of integer vectors where each entry corresponds to a point (denoted here as \eqn{i}) in \code{X}.
The vector for \eqn{i} contains the set of row indices of all points in \code{X} that lie within \code{threshold} of point \eqn{i}.
Points in each vector are not ordered, and \eqn{i} will always be included in its own set.
\item \code{distance}, if \code{get.distance=TRUE}.
This is a list of numeric vectors where each entry corresponds to a point (as above) and contains the distances of the neighbors from \eqn{i}.
Elements of each vector in \code{distance} match to elements of the corresponding vector in \code{index}.
}

If both \code{get.index=FALSE} and \code{get.distance=FALSE}, an integer vector is returned of length equal to the number of observations.
The \code{i}-th entry contains the number of neighbors of \eqn{i} within \code{threshold}.

If \code{subset} is not \code{NULL}, each entry of the above vector/lists corresponds to a point in the subset, in the same order as supplied in \code{subset}.
}
\description{
Find all neighboring data points within a certain distance of each point.
}
\details{
This function identifies all points in \code{X} that within \code{threshold} of each point in \code{X}.
For Euclidean distances, this is equivalent to identifying all points in a hypersphere centered around the point of interest.
Note all implementations support this search mode, but we can use \link{KmknnParam} and \linkS4class{VptreeParam}.

If \code{threshold} is a vector, each entry is assumed to specify a (possibly different) threshold for each point in \code{X}.
If \code{subset} is also specified, each entry is assumed to specify a threshold for each point in \code{subset}.
An error will be raised if \code{threshold} is a vector of incorrect length.

If multiple queries are to be performed to the same \code{X}, it may be beneficial to build the index from \code{X} with \code{\link{buildIndex}}.
The resulting pointer object can be supplied as \code{X} to multiple \code{findNeighbors} calls, avoiding the need to repeat index construction in each call.
