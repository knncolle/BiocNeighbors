\title{Distance to the k-th nearest neighbor}
\usage{
findDistanceFromIndex(BNINDEX, k, num.threads = 1, subset = NULL, ...)

\S4method{findDistanceFromIndex}{BiocNeighborGenericIndex}(BNINDEX, k, num.threads = 1, subset = NULL, ...)

findDistance(X, k, num.threads = 1, subset = NULL, ..., BNPARAM = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{BNINDEX}{A \linkS4class{BiocNeighborIndex} object, typically created by \code{\link{buildIndex}}.}

\item{k}{A positive integer scalar specifying the number of nearest neighbors to retrieve.

Alternatively, an integer vector of length equal to the number of points in \code{X}, specifying the number of neighbors to identify for each point.
If \code{subset} is provided, this should have length equal to the length of \code{subset}.
Users should wrap this vector in an \link{AsIs} class to distinguish length-1 vectors from integer scalars.

All \code{k} should be less than or equal to the number of points in \code{X} minus 1, otherwise the former will be capped at the latter with a warning.}

\item{num.threads}{Integer scalar specifying the number of threads to use for the search.}

\item{subset}{An integer, logical or character vector specifying the indices of points in \code{X} for which the nearest neighbors should be identified.
This yields the same result as (but is more efficient than) subsetting the output matrices after computing neighbors for all points.}

\item{...}{For \code{findDistanceFromIndex}, further arguments to pass to individual methods.
If a method accepts arguments here, it should prefix these arguments with the algorithm name to avoid conflicts, e.g., \code{vptree.foo.bar}.

For \code{findDistance}, further arguments to pass to \code{findDistanceFromIndex}.
These are also passed to \code{\link{buildIndex}} when \code{X} is not an external pointer.}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix or matrix-like object where rows correspond to data points and columns correspond to variables (i.e., dimensions).
Alternatively, a prebuilt \linkS4class{BiocNeighborIndex} object from \code{\link{buildIndex}}.}

\item{BNPARAM}{A \linkS4class{BiocNeighborParam} object specifying how the index should be constructed.
If \code{NULL}, this defaults to a \linkS4class{KmknnParam}.
Ignored if \code{X} contains a prebuilt index.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length equal to the number of points in \code{X} (or \code{subset}, if provided),
containing the distance from each point to its \code{k}-th nearest neighbor.
This is equivalent to but more memory efficient than using \code{\link{findKNN}} and subsetting to the last distance.
}
\description{
Find the distance to the k-th nearest neighbor for each point in a dataset.
}
\details{
If multiple queries are to be performed to the same \code{X}, it may be beneficial to build the index from \code{X} with \code{\link{buildIndex}}.
The resulting pointer object can be supplied as \code{X} to multiple \code{findDistance} calls, avoiding the need to repeat index construction in each call.
