# Overview

The `r self` package implements a variety of nearest-neighbor (NN) search algorithms with a consistent interface.
This includes exact search methods like 
[vantage point trees](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/313559.313789),
[k-means k-nearest neighbors](https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033373),
and an exhaustive brute-force search,
as well as approximate methods like 
[Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah (Annoy)](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)
and [hierarchical navigable small worlds (HNSW)](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib).
We provides methods to search nearest neighbors within a dataset, query across datasets,
and (for some algorithms) find all neighbors within a certain distance.

# Finding nearest neighbors

The `findKNN()` function will find the `k`-nearest neighbors within a dataset,
returning one matrix of neighbor identities and another matrix of (sorted) distances to each neighbor.

```{r}
# Mocking up a matrix with 'nobs' points in the rows
# and 'ndim' dimensions in the columns.
nobs <- 1000
ndim <- 20
data <- matrix(runif(nobs*ndim), ncol=ndim)

library(BiocNeighbors)
fout <- findKNN(data, k=10)
str(fout)
```

Each row of the `index` matrix corresponds to a row in `data` and contains the row indices in `data` that are its nearest neighbors.
For example, the 3rd point in `data` has the following nearest neighbors with their (sorted) distances:

```{r}
fout$index[3,]
fout$distance[3,]
```

Users can easily change the algorithm by setting the `BNPARAM=` argument.
For example, the code below switches to the Annoy algorithm for a faster, less accurate search.

```{r}
aout <- findKNN(data, k=10, BNPARAM=AnnoyParam())
str(aout)
```

The same mechanism can be used to change the distance metric from the Euclidean default.

```{r}
vout <- findKNN(data, k=10, BNPARAM=VptreeParam(distance="Manhattan"))
str(vout)
```

If the number of neighbors differs for each point, we can supply an integer vector to `k=` instead.
This yields a list of vectors containing the neighbors and their distances to each point.

```{r}
var.k <- sample(10, nrow(data), replace=TRUE)

# use I() to distinguish between scalar and length-1 vectors.
var.out <- findKNN(data, k=I(var.k))

head(var.out$index)
head(var.out$distance)
```

`queryKNN()` is a related function that will find the `k`-nearest neighbors in one dataset based on query points in another dataset.
Here, the rows of the output matrices correspond to rows of our `query` matrix.

```{r}
nquery <- 100
ndim <- 20
query <- matrix(runif(nquery*ndim), ncol=ndim)

qout <- queryKNN(data, query, k=5)
str(qout)
```

When performing multiple calls to `findKNN()` or `queryKNN()` on the same data,
advanced users may prefer to build the index first with `buildIndex()`.
This can be efficiently reused without repeating the index construction in each call.

```{r}
prebuilt <- buildIndex(data)
out1 <- findKNN(prebuilt, k=5)
out2 <- queryKNN(prebuilt, query, k=5)
```

# Finding all neighbors within range

In some applications, we need to find all neighboring points within a certain distance threshold.
This is achieved using the `findNeighbors()` function:

```{r}
nobs <- 8000
ndim <- 20
data <- matrix(runif(nobs*ndim), ncol=ndim)

fout <- findNeighbors(data, threshold=1)
head(fout$index)
head(fout$distance)
```

Each entry of the `index` list corresponds to a point in `data` and contains the row indices in `data` that are within `threshold`.
For example, the 3rd point in `data` has the following neighbors with the associated distances:

```{r}
fout$index[[3]]
fout$distance[[3]]
```

Again, we can switch algorithms by specifying `BNPARAM=`.
However, keep in mind that not all algorithms (particularly the approximate methods) support this range-based search.

```{r}
vparam <- VptreeParam(distance="Manhattan")
vout <- findNeighbors(data, threshold=1, BNPARAM=vparam)
```

`queryNeighbors()` is a related function that will identify all points within a certain distance of a query point.
Each entry of the returned `index` and `distance` corresponds to a row of `query` and describes its neighbors in `data`.

```{r}
nquery <- 100
ndim <- 20
query <- matrix(runif(nquery*ndim), ncol=ndim)
qout <- queryNeighbors(data, query, threshold=1)
head(qout$index)
```

As described above, advanced users can built the index first before repeated calls to `findNeighbors()` and `queryNeighbors()`.

```{r}
prebuilt <- buildIndex(data)
out1 <- findNeighbors(prebuilt, threshold=1)
out2 <- queryNeighbors(prebuilt, query,threshold=1)
```

If only the number of neighbors is of interest, we can set `get.index=FALSE` and `get.distance=FALSE` in the `findNeighbors()`/`queryNeighbors()` call.
This will count the number of neighbors without storing their identities/distances for greater memory efficiency.

```{r}
num <- findNeighbors(data, threshold=1, get.index=FALSE, get.distance=FALSE)
head(num)
```

# Usage in downstream C++ libraries 

R/Bioconductor package developers can use `r self` to perform nearest-neighbor searches in their own C++ code.
This uses the interfaces in the [**knncolle**](https://github.com/knncolle/knncolle) library to abstract away the underlying search methods.
First, we add some linking instructions in the `DESCRIPTION` to make the header files available:

```
LinkingTo: Rcpp, assorthead, BiocNeighbors
```

This includes the `BiocNeighbors.h` file that implements the `BiocNeigbors::Prebuilt` class:

```{r, results="hide"}
system.file("include", "BiocNeighbors.h", package="BiocNeighbors")
```

When a `buildIndex()` method returns an external pointer, that pointer is expected to refer to an instance of a `BiocNeighbors::Prebuilt`.
Thus, downstream code just needs to accept a pointer and cast it to a `BiocNeighbors::Prebuilt` for use in nearest-neighbor searches.
(The same approach can be applied to obtain a `BiocNeighbors::Builder` for construction of new indices.)

```cpp
SEXP do_something(SEXP raw_ptr, int k) {
    BiocNeighbors::PrebuiltPointer ptr(raw_ptr);
    const auto& prebuilt = ptr->index;
    auto searcher = prebuilt->initialize();

    std::vector<int> indices;
    std::vector<double> distances;
    searcher->search(0, k, &indices, &distances);

    return Rcpp::List::create(
        Rcpp::IntegerVector(indices.begin(), indices.end()),
        Rcpp::IntegerVector(distances.begin(), distances.end())
    );
}
```

Some extra work is required for cosine-normalized indices, which is indicated by `ptr->cosine == true`.
Any query data should also be L2-normalized before use in `Searcher::search()` or `Searcher::search_all()`.
(This is not required for overloads that accept an index for searching _within_ a dataset, only for queries between datasets.)

# Extending to new methods

## Introduction 

Developers can extend the `r self` framework to more algorithms through the creation of new `BiocNeighborParam` classes.
Users can then switch between algorithms by simply changing the `BNPARAM=` argument in their calls to `findKNN()`, etc.
In general, we recommend putting these extensions in a new R/Bioconductor package that adds more methods to the `r self` generics.
Developers can choose to write pure R extensions or they can write them partially in C++.

## In R

Each extension package should:

- Implement a `SomeNewParam` S4 class that inherits from `BiocNeighborParam`.
- Implement a `SomeNewIndex` S4 class that describes the index structure.
- Implement a `buildIndex()` S4 method, dispatching on a `matrix` type for `X=` and a `SomeNewParam` type for `BNPARAM=`.
  This should return an instance of `SomeNewIndex`.
- Implement two methods for each of `findKNN()` and `queryKNN()` (and optionally `findNeighbors()` `queryNeighbors()`).
  One method should dispatch on a `matrix` type for `X=` and a `SomeNewParam` type for `BNPARAM=`. 
  The other method should dispatch on a prebuilt `SomeNewIndex` type for `X=` and an `ANY` type for `BNPARAM=` (as the `BNPARAM=` is ignored for prebuilt indices).

## In C++

Alternatively, each extension package should:

- Implement C++ classes that inherit from the `Builder`, `Prebuilt` and `Searcher` interfaces in the [**knncolle**](https://github.com/knncolle/knncolle) library.
  This requires `LinkingTo: assorthead, BiocNeighbors` in the `DESCRIPTION`.
- Implement a `SomeNewParam` S4 class that inherits from `BiocNeighborParam`.
- Implement a `defineBuilder()` method, dispatching on a `matrix` type for `X=` and a `SomeNewParam` type for `BNPARAM=`.
  This should call into C++ and return an external pointer to an instance of a `BiocNeighbors::Builder` (see definition in `BiocNeighbors.h`).

No new methods are required for `findKNN()`, `queryNeighbors()`, etc. as the existing methods can be directly used with a pointer to a `BiocNeighbors::Prebuilt` instance.
This approach also allows the new method to be used in C++ code of downstream packages that accept a `BiocNeighbors::Prebuilt` instance.
