#' The AnnoyParam class
#'
#' A class to hold parameters for the Annoy algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor identification.
#' 
#' @param ntrees Integer scalar, number of trees to use for index generation.
#' @param search.mult Numeric scalar, multiplier for the number of points to search.
#' @inheritParams ExhaustiveParam
#' @param BNPARAM An AnnoyParam instance.
#' 
#' @details
#' The Approximate nearest neighbors Oh Yeah (Annoy) algorithm is based on recursive hyperplane partitions.
#' Briefly, a tree is constructed where a random hyperplane splits the points into two subsets at each internal node.
#' Leaf nodes are defined when the number of points in a subset falls below a threshold (close to twice the number of dimensions for the settings used here).
#' Multiple trees are constructed in this manner, each of which is different due to the random choice of hyperplanes.
#' For a given query point, each tree is searched to identify the subset of all points in the same leaf node as the query point. 
#' The union of these subsets across all trees is exhaustively searched to identify the actual nearest neighbors to the query.
#'
#' The \code{ntrees} parameter controls the trade-off between accuracy and computational work.
#' More trees provide greater accuracy at the cost of more computational work (both in terms of the indexing time and search speed in downstream functions).
#' 
#' The \code{search.mult} controls the parameter known as \code{search_k} in the original Annoy documentation. 
#' Specifically, \code{search_k} is defined as \code{k * search.mult} where \code{k} is the number of nearest neighbors to identify in downstream functions.
#' This represents the number of points to search exhaustively and determines the run-time balance between speed and accuracy.
#' The default \code{search.mult=ntrees} is based on the Annoy library defaults.
#' Note that this parameter is not actually used in the index construction itself, and is only included here so that the output index fully parametrizes the search.
#' 
#' Technically, the index construction algorithm is stochastic but, for various logistical reasons, the seed is hard-coded into the C++ code.
#' This means that the results of the Annoy neighbor searches will be fully deterministic for the same inputs, even though the theory provides no such guarantees.
#' 
#' @return
#' The \code{AnnoyParam} constructor returns an instance of the AnnoyParam class.
#'
#' The \code{\link{defineBuilder}} method returns an external pointer that can be used in \code{\link{buildIndex}} to construct an Annoy index.
