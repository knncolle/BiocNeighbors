#' The KmknnParam class
#'
#' A class to hold parameters for the k-means k-nearest-neighbors (KMKNN) algorithm for exact nearest neighbor identification.

#' @details
#' In the KMKNN algorithm (Wang, 2012), k-means clustering is first applied to the data points using the square root of the number of points as the number of cluster centers.
#' The cluster assignment and distance to the assigned cluster center for each point represent the KMKNN indexing information. 
#' This speeds up the nearest neighbor search by exploiting the triangle inequality between cluster centers, the query point and each point in the cluster to narrow the search space.
#' The advantage of the KMKNN approach is its simplicity and minimal overhead,
#' resulting in performance improvements over conventional tree-based methods for high-dimensional data where most points need to be searched anyway.
#' It is also trivially extended to find all neighbors within a threshold distance from a query point.
#'
#' Note that KMKNN operates much more naturally with Euclidean distances.
#' Computational efficiency may not be optimal when using it with other choices of \code{distance}, though the results will still be exact.
#'
#' @return
#' The \code{KmknnParam} constructor returns an instance of the KmknnParam class.
#'
#' The \code{\link{defineBuilder}} method returns an external pointer that can be used in \code{\link{buildIndex}} to construct a KMKNN index.
